I am a dual degree linguistics undergraduate student at the Beijing Language and Culture University and the University of Manchester. 

I am supervised by [Dr. Ye Feng at BLCU](https://linguistics.blcu.edu.cn/info/1281/3013.htm). (You can find me at the bottom of the webpage.) and Dr. Colin Bannard at Manchester. 

I mainly focus on phonetics and prosodic analysis of speech, as well as their applications in clinical studies.

Feel free to contact me [here](mailto:b.zhang803@foxmail.com) or [here](mailto:bomiao.zhang@student.manchester.ac.uk).
