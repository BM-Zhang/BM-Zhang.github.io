I am an undergraduate student at [Department of Linguistics, Beijing Language and Culture University](https://linguistics.blcu.edu.cn/). Currently I am studying at the University of Manchester as part of [a 2+2 articulation programme](https://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/connect/collaborative-partnerships/). 

During my time in Beijing I was supervised by [Dr. Ye Feng at Dept. of Ling, BLCU](https://linguistics.blcu.edu.cn/info/1281/3013.htm). (You can find me at the bottom of the webpage.)

I am currently supervised by Dr. Colin Bannard. 

I mainly focus on phonetics and prosodic analysis of speech, as well as their applications in clinical studies.
