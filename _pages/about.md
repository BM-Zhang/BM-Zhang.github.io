I am a undergraduate student at [Department of Linguistics, Beijing Language and Culture University](https://linguistics.blcu.edu.cn/). Currently I am studying in the University of Manchester as part of [a 2+2 articulation programme](https://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/connect/collaborative-partnerships/). 

I am supervised by [Dr. Ye Feng at Dept. of Ling, BLCU](https://linguistics.blcu.edu.cn/info/1268/2404.htm).

My main interest is in Phonetics, Speech perception and Clinical Linguistics.
