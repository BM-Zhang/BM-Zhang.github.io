I am a postgraduate student in the [EMCL-25 programme](emcl.eu).

Previously I was a dual degree Linguistics undergraduate student at Beijing Language and Culture University and the University of Manchester, under supervision of [Dr. Ye Feng](https://faculty.blcu.edu.cn/fengye/zh_CN/index.htm).

I primarily focus on phonetics and prosodic analysis of speech, with a particular interest in their clinical applications.

Currently I am collaborating with Department of Neurology (Prof. Xiaohong Li) at Dalian Municipal Friendship Hospital on a project investigating prosodic features in the speech of Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease.
