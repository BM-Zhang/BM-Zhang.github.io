I am a postgraduate student in the [EMCL-25 programme](https://emcl.eu/).

Previously I was an undergraduate student in the [dual-degree Linguistics programme](https://www.alc.manchester.ac.uk/connect/collaborative-partnerships/) at Beijing Language and Culture University and the University of Manchester, under supervision of [Dr. Ye Feng](https://faculty.blcu.edu.cn/fengye/zh_CN/index.htm).

I primarily focus on phonetics and prosodic analysis of speech, with a particular interest in their clinical applications.

Currently I am collaborating with Department of Neurology (Prof. Xiaohong Li) at Dalian Municipal Friendship Hospital on a project investigating prosodic features in the speech of Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease.
