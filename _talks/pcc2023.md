In April 2024 I did an English version of the presentation at ULAB 2024 held at the University of Sussex.
Here is the [video recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dlMojkQnvfYY8jJxmpPeALesL-wFPd7n/view?usp=sharing) (sorry for the terrible audio) and the [slides](https://bm-zhang.github.io/files/ULAB2024-Bomiao-Zhang-Pres.pptx). 

There is also a poster version which I presented at MEDAL Summer School in Experimental Linguistics at Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, Nijmegen, Netherlands.
