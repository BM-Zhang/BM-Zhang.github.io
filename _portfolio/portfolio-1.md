From 2025 the Department of Linguistics at Beijing Language and Culture University ceased to exist after merging into the newly established School of Linguistics and Language Resources. 

Here is a selection of media and promotional materials that I did for the department, as a memorial for both the department and my enthusiastic undergraduate life at BLCU. 

[This](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M0Zj2pARIWMfaCPQppBNxa6DqPDYUhGX/view?usp=sharing) is an introduction video of the department. It was used in summer schools and welcoming ceremonies for new students. It is by no mean a high quality video but it functions properly as a promotional material.

This is the logo that I designed for the Institute for Chomsky Studies, Dept of Ling, BLCU.

You can see the logo in this [news article](https://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2022/9/486677.shtm) about the inauguration ceremony of the institute.
