From 2025 the Department of Linguistics at Beijing Language and Culture University ceased to exist after merging into the newly established School of Linguistics and Language Resources. 

Here is a selection of media and promotional materials that I have done for the department, as a memorial for the department and my enthusiastic undergraduate life at BLCU.

This is the logo that I designed for the Institute for Chomsky Studies, Dept of Ling, BLCU.
