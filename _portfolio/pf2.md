[This](https://space.bilibili.com442576231) is a fansub community that I led since 2019. These videos uploaded are mainly subbed video vlips of a group of virtual youtubers called NIJISANJI ID.   

I learned how to add subtitles to videos when I was 14, which was purely just for fun.   

It was pretty entertaining to align the sentences and speech using spectrogram in the subtitle software (aegisub). Little did I know that this would eventually become my career.
