[This](https://space.bilibili.com/442576231) is a fansub community that I led since 2019. We make Chinese subtitles and video clips for what used to be the Indonesian branch of a vtuber agency called [NIJISANJI](https://www.nijisanji.jp/en/talents). The fansub is recogonised but not lisenced by NIJISANJI.

I started doing subtitles when I was 14, which was purely just for fun.   

Aligning sentences with speech using spectrograms in subtitle software (namely Aegisub) turned out to be surprisingly entertaining. Little did I know that this would eventually shape my future career.
